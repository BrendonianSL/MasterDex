# What Is MasterDex?

MasterDex is a website created as a final project for the Front End Web Development Certification provided by Codecademy. This project will be using the PokeAPI to help display information relevant to the Pokemon Video Games. This project is currently a work in progress.

## Features

PokeAPI Data:

MasterDex uses PokeAPI to fetch data about all pokemon and display it back to the user. This allows the site to perform functions based on that data to display information to the user.

Search:

MasterDex allows site users to search pokemon by name throughout the site through the use of the searchbar.
